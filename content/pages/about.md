Title: About

Yep, now I have a blog.

Here is just yet another blog about crappy programmers, insane vendors and savage russian hackers, all what we love so much will be there. I promise (really) to update it every week at least once. Most of the material at this blog will be my loose translations of arbitrary articles of random guys which I consider to be cool enough. Any feedback is consciously absent. I don't really think that you need it, as for me too. Just read, or not. Who cares?
