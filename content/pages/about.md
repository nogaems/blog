Title: About

Yep, now I have a blog.

Here is yet another blog with crappy programmers, insane vendors and savage russian hackers, all that we love so much will be there. I promise (really) update it every week at least one time. Most of the material at this blog will be my loose translations of arbitrary articles of guys these I think are cool. Any feedback is consciously absent. I don't really think that you need it, as for me too. Just read, or not. Who cares?
